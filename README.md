# Recovery_Rob
A rescue robot to aid in recovery efforts of a simulated building collapse created in CopelliaSim.

A condominium collapses in south Florida. Firefighters and first responders canâ€™t readily enter the building. Over 100 people are missing. There are completely collapsed floors, exposed walls, pieces of furniture, and other large debris making the task of finding these missing persons incredibly challenging. The first responders are using recovery Rob to assess the safety of the situation and scan for possible missing persons before entering each floor, if possible.

Recovery rob is a modified bubble robot created in CopeliaSim using the procedural programming language Lua. It is equipped with infrared sensors to search for possible survivors, as well as ultrasonic sensors for navigation, and a vision sensor to survey the scene for possible obstacles and help the first responders assess the safety of the scene from a safe distance. It also tracks the proximity of possible survivors in relation to itself.

You will notice Recovery Rob measures the and reports the distance of possible victims in meters to help aid rescue efforts.
